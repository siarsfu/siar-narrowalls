# Unity rules of play

•	All terrains have to be in one folder

•	Work in separate “branch” scenes and then send prefabs over to main scene

•	All names with underscore or similar, **no spaces**

•	Keep the folders like “Models, Audio, Scenes, Scripts..” for models, audio, etc.

•	Do not change the plugin installation path, leave them where they are installed
